Overview:
The Contact Card Management System is a web application developed using React.js, leveraging modern JavaScript features and React hooks such as useState, useEffect, and useNavigate. The system provides users with a form to input their contact information, including name and email address. The entered data is then stored and managed using APIs implemented with Axios for CRUD operations, interacting with a JSON server for data persistence.

Key Features:

Input Form: The application features a user-friendly form where users can input their contact details, including name and email address.
State Management: React hooks such as useState are utilized for managing the state of the form inputs and contact data.
API Integration: Axios is used to interact with RESTful APIs, enabling CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing contact data stored on a JSON server.
Navigation: React Router's useNavigate hook is employed for seamless navigation between different views within the application, enhancing user experience and flow.
Data Persistence: The application stores contact information in a JSON server, ensuring data persistence across sessions and enabling retrieval and modification of stored data.
Responsive Design: CSS is utilized for styling, ensuring the application is responsive and accessible across various devices and screen sizes.
Technologies Used:

React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
React Hooks: useState, useEffect, useNavigate for managing state and navigation within the application.
Axios: HTTP client for making requests to APIs, facilitating communication with the JSON server.
JSON Server: Lightweight server used for storing and managing contact data.
React Router: Library for declarative routing in React applications, enabling navigation between different views.
Project Structure:

App.js: Main component orchestrating the application's functionality, including routing and state management.
ContactForm.js: Component rendering the input form for capturing contact information.
ContactList.js: Component displaying a list of stored contact cards and facilitating CRUD operations.
api.js: Module containing functions for interacting with the JSON server via Axios for CRUD operations.
styles.css: Stylesheet containing CSS rules for styling the components and ensuring a visually appealing user interface.
